Unit 1 : Question 1
Why would you wipe a hard disk of the forensics machine before data acquisition?
*To make sure unwanted data is not retained on a disk
To remove finger prints
To ensure it has enough space
Data on a hard disk cannot be overwritten

Unit 1 : Question 2
After acquiring the volatile data, how should you shut down a desktop computer for a non-volatile data acquisition?
Performing a graceful shut down 
*Pulling the plug from the computer
Either of the above

Unit 1 : Question 3
Which of these will create a bit-stream image?
cp
dump
*FTK Imager
tar

Unit 1 : Question 4
When calculating hashes on files and file systems, why should you use two different hashing algorithms (for example: md5 and sha1)?
Using an alternate algorithm ensures the minimum number of bit-comparisons can be performed.
Using a second hashing algorithm provides additional functions that enhance the perceived file content.
A second hashing algorithm can help the hash performance.
*If one hash is questioned, the second can help provide an alternate data validation mechanism.

Unit 1 : Question 5
True or False: Changing a file's permission(s) will change the file's hash result.
True
*False

Unit 1 : Question 6
If a hard disk contains multiple partitions, a hash of this hard disk using a hash algorithm________:
computes a hash of the first partition only
*computes a hash of the entire hard disk correct
computes a hash of the existing files only
does not include deleted data

Unit 1 : Question 7
When collecting evidence from a suspect machine for a forensic investigation, all output should be directed to:
The internal hard disk of the suspect machine
*An external disk or storage media that has been wiped clean 
Either of the above

Unit 1: Question 8
Which of the fillowing is nonvolatile data?
Processes running in memory
Memory (RAM)
Open-files (The files that are currently being accessed by one or more processes)
*Data stored on a USB flash drive 
Network connections

Unit 1: Question 9
True or false: Forensic Chain-of-custody maintains a record of how evidence has been handled from the moment it was collected to the moment it is presented in a court.
*True
False

Unit 1: Question 10
In 1999, Farmer and Venema presented the forensic process and the first computer forensics suite called__________ that marked the beginning of the computer forensics field.
FTK Imager
Forensic Suite
*The Coroner's Toolkit (TCT)
Sleuthikit
