For this assignment, you should write the code needed for the method getAccessiblePorts to scan the given range of ports. The method should scan the ports at a given address, and then return the list of ports that have a service listening for them.

Once completed, submit your solution to the TMC server for assessment.

Note that while we implement port scanners and other tools, we will later also look into existing software that have similar functionality.
