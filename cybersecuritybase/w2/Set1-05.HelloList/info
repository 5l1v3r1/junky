In this assignment we will look into using lists and using them as data for the templates.

The assignment has the server side functionality that handles a request to the root path and adds a list for processing for Thymeleaf. The template that is used to create the site is missing some functionality however.

Your task is to (1) print the values in the list using the th:each-attribute that we saw previously, and (2) add a form that can be used to send content to the server.

Once finished, submit the assignment to the TMC server.
