A. We knew-it-all-along
* B. The database group caused the outage
C. That is the same problem we saw last week
D. Had we been there, the outage would have not happened. incorrect 

NOTE: some examples:

hindsight bias - You know, "Yes, we knew it all along" ... it's this idea of seeing the event as having been predictable ... certainly, counterfactuals ...  "Oh, if they would have just used Chef, this would have never happened", right?
Like, not picking on Chef, you know, but any ... Ansible ... "If they would have just used Ansible ..."

outcome bias - you know, evaluating the quality of a decision when the outcome of that decision is already known, right? That's
That's, you know ... it's easy to say "Well, that happened because of, you know, XYZ ... We've seen that before ..." One of the worst things are when you actually kind of miraculously dive in and save ... avert a disastrous problem, right?
To think that like, that, since you did XYZ, this would never happen again, right? And ...
In fact, there's a whole study of what they call ... Dekker calls ... precursors, or this kind of near-miss idea that, you know, that you think you've solved it a bunch of times ...
In fact, Diane Vaughan, I referred to this in one of the sections, where Diane Vaughan, created this ... when she researched the Challenger disaster, she came up with this concept of the normalization of deviance, right?
Which I would say is kind of a form of an outcome bias, where you, you know, you get kind of used to making mistakes, and, because it doesn't really break when you make those mistakes, in the future you'll say "Oh, don't worry about that, we do that all the time ..."

availability bias - the preference by decision makers to information and events that are more recent. Like, this idea, so, you're looking for the most recent event to answer a question. Now, there's a ...
There's a trade-off between kind of, you know, the heuristics of wha's the simplest answer, there's this concept of, called Occam's razor, which, you know, I'm going to completely oversimplify, but sometimes, the simplest answer is the right answer, or the best answer, right?
But, just ... you need to be aware that we are suspect to these availability biases, right? So, we can wind up like thinking like, the thing that happened yesterday is the thing that happened today ... We got to be really careful.

fundamental attribution error - And probably, the worst of all, I think is, you know, I think the fundamental attribution error is the kind of deadliest cognitive sin,
and that is where we try to explain behaviors on kind of personality traits, or abilities, or motives, where, you know, "Bill is always sloppy with his code, so, surely, that's why the system went down", or "The system is broken. It must have been Sue".
I remember an example one time, where I was with this one guy, he was pretty aggressive, it was a big mainframe days, but like, one day, everybody was in the hallway, the system went down, they were all complaining about how Joe brought the system down
and I pointed out to them all that Joe was on vacation that week, right? So ...
Again, a fundamental attribution error ...
