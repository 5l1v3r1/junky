UNIT 6: Question 10
Comparing correlation and regression, which statement is not true?
Correlation quantifies the degree to which two attributes X and Y are related, but it does not fit a line through the data.
*Regressions can only be linear relationships.
The correlation coefficient indicates the extent to which two variables move together, while regression coefficient indicates the impact of a unit change in the known variable (X) on the estimated variable (Y).
The regression is a method of finding an equation Y=f(X) that can be used to make predictions for Y based on the value of X.
